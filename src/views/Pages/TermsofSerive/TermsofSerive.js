<p>Your use of MotherClock’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the
“Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by MotherClock under a
separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and

<p>(B) using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that MotherClock will treat your use of the
Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>
<p>You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a
binding contract with MotherClock, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the
laws of Canada or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use
the Services.</p>
<p>In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information about yourself or your

MotherClock will always be accurate, correct and up to date.</p>
<p>While we will do everything possible to ensure that the Services meets and exceeds your expectations,
you expressly understand and agree that:</p>
<p>(A) your use of the Services is at your sole risk and that the Services are provided “as is” and “as
available”; and</p>

or Additional Terms have changed, MotherClock will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms
and Conditions or Additional Terms.</p>
